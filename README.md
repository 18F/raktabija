## Raktabija

The demon Raktabija had a superpower that meant that when a drop of his blood hit the ground, a new duplicate Raktabija would be created. Thus when the goddess Kali fought him, every time she wounded him, multiple new Raktabijas would be created. The goddess Chandika helped Kali kill all the clone Raktabijas and eventually killed Raktabija himself. The Chandika app is designed to help you kill the profusion of unused virtual resources that accumulate in a
typical cloud environment.
